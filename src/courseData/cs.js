    "description": "An introduction to the principles of computer science with an emphasis on creative expression through the medium of a programming language. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the computational structures needed to solve problems and produce computational artifacts which address these problems in real-world contexts. Students also learn how to organize and document a program's source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers. Additionally, the introduction includes an overview of the discipline of computer science and computational thinking. During a weekly laboratory session students use industry-grade technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.",

    "description": "An investigation of select topics in computer and information science that prepares students for the completion of a senior project with the purpose of identifying knowledge gaps in the discipline. Students learn how to read scholarly papers, state and motivate research questions, create a software prototype or develop scholarly artifacts to address their findings, and collect and organize evidence for evaluating the outcome of their project. During a weekly laboratory session students use industry-grade technology to gain practical skills in technical writing, the presentation of technical concepts, and the production of an artifact. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.",
